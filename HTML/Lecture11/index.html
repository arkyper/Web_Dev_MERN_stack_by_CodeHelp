    <!-- The loading attribute specifies whether a browser should load an image immediately or to defer loading of off-screen images until for example the user scrolls near them.
    eager	Default. Loads an image immediately
    lazy	Defer loading of images until some conditions are met
    lazy : Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.
    eager : Default loading behavior of the browser, which is the same as not including the attribute and means the image is loaded regardless of where it's located on the page. -->
